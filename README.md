# HCG_trigger_of_GnRHa-induced_FC
 This is a retrospective study consists of 657 HRT-FET cycles with GnRHa pretreatment. Patients were divided into the function cysts (FC) group and no functional cysts (NC) group according to whether the patient developed FC (follicular diameter≥7mm and E2≥100pg/ml). Risk factors associated with the incidence of GnRHa-induced FC are determined by multivariate regression analysis. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between the FC group and NC group. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce the impact of confounding factors. Three multivariate regression models adjusted with confounding factors were performed to assess the association of HCG trigger of GnRHa-induced FC and clinical pregnancy. Interactive analysis and subgroup analysis based on age were analyzed by regression models.
